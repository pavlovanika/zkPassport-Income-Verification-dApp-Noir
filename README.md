# zkPassport-Income-Verification-dApp-Noir
This dApp simulates a **zkPassport income verification** process built in **Noir**, allowing users to prove they meet certain financial criteria **without disclosing their actual income**.   The concept follows the privacy-first principles of **Aztec**, **Zama**, and other zero-knowledge ecosystems.
